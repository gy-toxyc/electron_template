</h2>

- The folder **"docs"** works as a tutorial here for every basic action you'll take installing and packaging your electron project into a desktop application.

- Firstly, read carefully the **"GET_STARTED.md"** file, it'll teach you how to install Electron and NodeJS modules. Just after installing those, you'll have optional instalations such as BabelJS (recommended for ES6 modules) and TypeScript. It will also put your project inside Electron Forge so you can test it while coding.

- You must aknowledge that the directories **"node_modules"** and **"electron_base"** are mandatory for the project to work properly. You can delete **"docs"** once your project is already set up, as it's just a tutorial. Also, it may be cleared before or after, but this template works as a tutorial to set up your Electron project, but not as a tutorial of how Electron and NodeJS works, if you need information about those technologies, all documentations of each one will be provided at the end of this document.

- Secondly, in order to try your code, read the **"PACKING.md"** file, but just take the first 2 commands yet, as the last one will be the last part of your development process.

- And in the end, by now, you can execute the last command on **"PACKING.md"** to pack your project into a distributable desktop application.

<h4>Sadly, this template does not cover update handling yet, as I'm still learning about it, to be honest. But I recomment you actively to visit Electron documentation which covers this concept.</h4>
