<h3 align="center">
<i>This tutorial will teach you how to pack up your Electron project into a distributable desktop application, and where to find it.</i>
</h3><br>

<b><i>1. Execute this command.</b></i>
</h2>

<h4>Execute the next command into any terminal, but being careful to execute it being inside the whole project directory.</h4>
<br>

> npm run make

<br>

<b><i>2. Where do I find the distributable?</b></i>
</h2>

<h4>The process of packing your project will take some time, but after it's already finished, you'll notice a new directory on your project named <b>"out"</b>, which will contain 2 folders. The distributable is the one that is not the "make" one, which will have a name similar to <b><i>"YOURPROJECT-win32-x64"</b></i>. That is, actually, the distributable desktop application, with the executable on the inside with the same name as your project.</h4>
